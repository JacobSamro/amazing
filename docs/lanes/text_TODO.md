# Text lane decision map

## TEXT-1: font matching and named-family fallback

Fixed base: `d2a610ede8f254b8da1be9121d59dbd7cf598e78`.

Decision: select faces in CSS family-list order. Within a family, match width,
style, then weight before testing glyph coverage. If the selected face lacks a
cluster, advance through the remaining named families before installed fallback.
Private-use characters only use explicitly named families. The Windows driver
registers a bounded set of pinned CSSTest faces when `AMAZING_WPT_ROOT` is set.
Use synthetic oblique when the selected face has no matching italic face.

Evidence: `crates/amazing-text-provider/evidence/text1-fonts-manifest.json`
pins 15 CSS Fonts cases at WPT revision
`c2a2fce69e5c2509d9dc28440ec8b42532e5c293`. Untouched baseline was
5 pass, 10 mismatch, twice. Final candidate was 11 pass, 4 mismatch, twice,
with identical classifications and actual PPM hashes across runs: six gains,
zero losses. Four gains (`font-family-name-018`, `-019`, `-022`, and
`test-synthetic-italic`) match the Chrome 154 / Safari 26.6 consensus recorded
in the CSS-8 triage. `font-family-name-000` and `-024` also pass locally, but
both reference browsers fail those pinned cases. The remaining mismatches are
`font-variant-ligatures-11`, the PUA primary-font case, and
`first-available-font-002`/`-003`.

On the same pinned revision, text-flow stayed 14/16, text-shaping stayed
12/12, and vertical-ruby stayed 11/20 from untouched baseline to two candidate
runs. There were no classification losses, and both candidate runs had
identical actual PPM hashes for every case. One already-mismatching
vertical-ruby case changed pixels between baseline and candidate.

Follow-up: layout must pass parsed `font-feature-settings` and
`font-variant-ligatures` into `TextStyle.features`. The provider already passes
OpenType feature tags to HarfRust; the missing policy handoff is queued with
the primary integrator.
