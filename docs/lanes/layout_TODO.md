# Layout lane decision map

## LAYOUT-1 — Floats and clearance (completed prototype; stopped at review boundary)

### Design

- `floats.rs` owns margin-box exclusion geometry: left/right placement,
  source-order top constraints, next-bottom search, side-specific clear and
  line-band queries. Ordinary blocks share a context; independent BFCs own one.
- `block.rs` removes floats from normal stack advancement, resolves shrink-to-fit
  with the existing intrinsic-width interface, and includes contained floats in
  auto heights. BFC border boxes avoid float bands over their full height.
- Clearance preserves locked decision 4b: stacking returns content extent,
  trailing collapsed margin and whether clearance prevents that group escaping.
  An empty cleared box still collapses with following empty siblings.
- `inline.rs` consults exclusion bands for legacy and shaped line placement,
  moves unbreakable first content below an obstruction, and restores full line
  width below float bottoms. Anonymous blocks inherit explicit zero line-height.
- Float-bearing shaped documents resolve text during block placement so following
  blocks see provider line heights. Float-free documents keep the existing path.
- Box construction blockifies floating inline elements while preserving Flex/Grid
  inner formatting contexts. No changes to form-control construction in this ticket.

Rules consulted: [CSS 2.1 float placement](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#float-position),
[float widths](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#float-width), and
[clearance and collapsing margins](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins).

### Measured evidence

Windows layout unit tests: **138/138 before → 150/150 after**. Twelve new
interface-level tests cover packing, margins, side-selective clear, BFC height
and isolation, line shortening/recovery in both text paths, overwide words,
shrink-to-fit, full-height BFC avoidance, zero line-height, cleared empty margin
groups, and floated inline-flex formatting.

Pinned WPT revision: `c2a2fce69e5c2509d9dc28440ec8b42532e5c293`.
All runs use an 800 × 600 viewport. Counts below are pass / mismatch; every
selection has zero timeout, unsupported and crash results.

| Selection | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broad geometry | 32 / 29 | 31 / 30 |
| Eight-case float shard | 2 / 6 | 6 / 2 |
| Block collapse | 9 / 0 | 9 / 0 |
| Position | 9 / 3 | 9 / 3 |
| Text flow | 14 / 2 | 14 / 2 |
| Focused flex/grid | 24 / 0 | 24 / 0 |
| Focused paint | 24 / 0 | 24 / 0 |

Geometry and float selections have two identical normalized pixel-hash
projections both before and after. The brief's historical 38/61 geometry count
does not reproduce with the unchanged current renderer (32/61 measured).
Broad raw regressions: `float-nowrap-3.html` and
`float-table-align-left-quirk.html`; gain: `float-nowrap-3-ref.html` (an upstream
mismatch reftest). These remain visible in the evidence, not reclassified.

Full Windows workspace: **737 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored**, exit **0**.
Ignored tests require external HTTPS or an interactive D3D11 device. An initial
PowerShell `Start-Process -Wait` wrapper failed to return after the passing test
process exited; the cached workspace run was repeated through `cmd /c` to
capture exit 0. No local builds or tests were run.

Normalized results, selection, run ids and actual/reference/diff hashes:
[`layout1-results.json`](../../crates/amazing-layout/evidence/layout1-results.json)
and the seven sibling `*-results.json` files. The final executable is
`C:\Users\server\target\layout\layout1-final.exe`, SHA256
`4f18246d7fade784742391e576de16eeafaee4be89a6108daf67649c21a577e7`.
The lane rebased to `origin/dev` at `e9c1e21`; the integrator-owned lockfile
SHA256 is `aa0a0d8fd69000e161ad26ac31d2ea3a988152cce75fdcb4e1277ff8480b2d25`.
No root files or other lanes' source were edited.

The source checkout is lane-local at `C:\Users\server\target\layout\wpt`.
The shared WPT tree omitted most selected files; incomplete-source probe runs
are excluded. `crates/amazing-layout/evidence/run-layout1.ps1` reproduces the
selection, two repeats and the five regression gates with a pinned executable.

### Prototype boundary / known limitations

- Mid-inline floats still split anonymous inline runs instead of resuming one
  source line. The float shard retains `float-nowrap-3` and
  `floats-line-wrap-shifted-001` as mismatches.
- The geometry corpus includes a floated table/quirks case whose former equal
  pixels change when float placement becomes active. Table formatting is still
  deferred; record this as a raw regression, not a supported pass.
- Float shrink-to-fit uses the existing legacy intrinsic-width approximation;
  provider-shaped intrinsic widths, vertical writing-mode exclusion, exact
  inline static-position rectangles and broader table/inline-block behavior
  remain outside this prototype's supported slice.
- Do not equate the raw reftest pass count with complete CSS float conformance.

## LAYOUT-2 — Atomic inline form controls (queued; do not start)

Integrator queued this after the replaced-content lane found that both inline
replaced-element branches in `box_tree.rs` recognize only `img`, discarding
form controls before paint.

Construct atomic inline boxes for text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons,
buttons and selects. Provide intrinsic sizing and styled replaced-fragment
metadata through the existing
`ReplacedElementProvider::intrinsic_size(NodeIdx) -> Option<IntrinsicSize>`
seam. Begin only after LAYOUT-1 finishes and the integrator assigns LAYOUT-2.
